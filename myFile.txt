It's the monsoon in Lahore, sweeping rain washing down the red brick of the Gaddafi Stadium complex. The drainage system, ill equipped to handle what the monsoon unleashes in this part of Pakistan, has long given up, water spilling back out onto the streets just outside the PCB's offices in the complex. Still, the place is packed with journalists and TV reporters, because in an intimate little room nestled behind the open-plan office space, Pakistan's T20 captain will spare a few minutes for a chat with the media. ahsanali.bscssef20@iba-suk.edu.pk
The room was obviously never built to house a dozen TV cameras, and so, instead of sitting at the head of the conference table, the biggest name in Pakistan cricket stands in a corner as questions are breathlessly volleyed at him. He repeats the usual platitudes about players needing to do their best, emphasises the importance of coping with pressure, and - bless him - expresses satisfaction that New Zealand and England are coming to Pakistan to play seven T20Is ahead of the World Cup. Babar Azam isn't exactly the most engaging speaker, especially not in a crowd. Every word of his is scrutinised and sensationalised by the fans and the media, so being predictably dull is a rather useful skill to possess.
